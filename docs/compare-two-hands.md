## Comparing Two Hands in Blackjack

### The following describes who wins in our blackjack game.

 1. Find sum of dealer and player hands.
 2. If dealer has Blackjack (value 10 card and Ace) dealer wins.
 3. If any hand contains one or more aces, aces are "soft" (11 points) unless it makes 
 the sum greater than 21. If sum becomes greater than 21, Ace is considered (1 point). 
 4. If the sum of the dealer's hand is greater than the sum of the player's 
 hand without going over 21, the dealer wins.
 5. If the sum of the player's hand is greater than the sum of the dealer's
 hand without going over 21, the player wins. 
 6. If the dealer sum is equal to the players sum, the dealer wins the tie.
 7. If both the dealer and the player sum is greater than 21, the dealer
 wins.
